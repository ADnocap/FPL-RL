# Weekly gameweek routine (live 2026-27 season)

## Steps

1. **Check the deadline first.** `GET https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/`
   → events → the `is_next` event's `deadline_time`. Tell the user how long is left.
   If < 15 minutes, run with `--skip-refresh` (saves ~10 min of element downloads).

2. **Run the driver** (`FPL_TEAM_ID` is already in `.env` — entry 8737706 —
   and is picked up automatically):
   ```
   python scripts/gameweek.py
   ```
   - GW1 or wildcard-from-scratch: add `--fresh-squad`
   - Chip evaluation: re-run with `--chip wildcard` / `free_hit` / `bench_boost` /
     `triple_captain` and compare objective values against the no-chip run
   - Sanity check: re-run with `--ep` and compare — large disagreements between the
     model and FPL's EP deserve a look (usually injury/rotation news the model
     can't see).

3. **Review before presenting**:
   - Flag any recommended player with `status` d/i/s in bootstrap or
     `chance_of_playing_next_round < 100` (news field says why).
   - Check `transfers made > free_transfers` → mention the hit cost explicitly.
   - DGW/BGW: check fixture counts for GW in `data/raw/2026-27/fixtures.csv`.

4. **Present**: transfers (out→in with prices), XI + formation, captain/vice,
   bench order, expected points, hit cost if any. Then apply via the API:
   `python scripts/gameweek.py --apply` (dry-run validation), then
   `--apply --yes` to commit for real. Auth is `FPL_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env`
   (auto-rotating; see src/fpl_rl/live/auth.py if it ever needs re-extracting).
   When recommending players by name, ALWAYS disambiguate with club + position
   (two Palmers exist: Cole Palmer CHE MID vs Alex Palmer IPS GK).

## Failure modes

- Model predictions empty → season files not rebuilt; run without `--skip-build`.
- `Entry has no completed gameweek` → GW1 hasn't finished; use `--fresh-squad`.
- Element summaries stale mid-GW → fine; rolling features only use completed GWs.
- After the GW completes, scores are final 09:00 UK the NEXT day (2026-27
  lockdown rule) — don't rebuild training data before that.

## Weekly cadence (already in the user's Google Calendar, green events)

Snapshot + recommendation ideally the evening before the deadline, final check
1-2h before. Deadlines vary: Fri 19:30, Sat 12:00-15:30, some midweek Wed —
always read `deadline_time` from the API, never assume.
