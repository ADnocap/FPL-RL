"""Pre-deadline predictions for the upcoming GW of the live season.

Runs the trained LightGBM PointPredictor over the live-built season files
(which include synthetic rows for the upcoming GW — see
``fpl_rl.data.collectors.fpl_live``).  DGW players get their per-row
prediction summed; BGW players simply have no row and fall back to 0.
