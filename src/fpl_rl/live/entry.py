"""Fetch a real FPL team (entry) from the public API and build a GameState.

Uses only public endpoints (no login):

- ``entry/{id}/``                 -> current event
- ``entry/{id}/history/``         -> chips played, per-GW bank/transfers
- ``entry/{id}/event/{gw}/picks/``-> squad, lineup, captain, bank (post-deadline)
- ``entry/{id}/transfers/``       -> full transfer history with prices

Purchase prices are reconstructed from the transfer history; players held
since GW1 use ``now_cost - cost_change_start`` (their season-start price).
Selling prices apply the 50%-of-appreciation rule.

Limitation: transfers already made for the UPCOMING gameweek are only visible
on the authenticated ``my-team`` endpoint, so run recommendations before
making transfers on the site.
