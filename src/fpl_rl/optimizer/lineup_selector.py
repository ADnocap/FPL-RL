def select_lineup(

) -> OptimizerResult:
    """Select optimal starting XI, captain, vice-captain, and bench order.

    Solves a binary MILP:
        max  sum(xP_i * y_i) + sum(xP_i * c_i) + 0.1 * sum(xP_i * v_i)
             + bench auto-sub EV (weighted bench GK + slot-weighted outfield)
    where y_i=1 means player i starts, c_i=1 means captain, v_i=1 means
    vice-captain. Bench slot assignment is part of the MILP so bench order
    is optimized, not a post-hoc sort.

    Parameters
    ----------
    squad : list[PlayerCandidate]
        Exactly 15 players (2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD).
