"""Betting odds features for point prediction.

Computes match-level implied probability features from historical
Pinnacle h2h odds, then maps them to each player via their team.

Anti-lookahead guarantee
------------------------
The odds collector stores a snapshot taken ~2 hours BEFORE the GW's
first kickoff.  At that point, all odds are pre-match and publicly
available — no information leaks from match outcomes.

Features (per element per GW)
-----------------------------
odds_team_win_prob    : Normalised implied probability that the player's
                        team wins their match (averaged for DGW).
odds_team_draw_prob   : Normalised implied draw probability.
odds_team_loss_prob   : Normalised implied probability that the player's
                        team loses.
odds_team_strength    : win_prob - loss_prob  (signed favouritism measure).
